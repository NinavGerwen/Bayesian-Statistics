# Bayesian-Statistics

Repository for the course of 'Bayesian Statistics' I followed at Utrecht University. 
The repository contains both the weekly exercises and the final assignment: programming our own Gibbs Sampler with the option to also run a Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm in order to perform a standard multiple linear regression.
