# Cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD: Is PE more effective than the baseline PC?

model{

# likelihood of the data
y.PE ~ dbin(theta.PE, n.PE)
y.PC ~ dbin(theta.PC, n.PC)

# prior distributions
theta.PE ~ dbeta(41,66)
theta.PC ~ dbeta(46,86)

## If you wanted to weight for 0.5, you'd multiple all the numbers by 0.5 in the dbeta arguments

# contrast
RR <- theta.PC/theta.PE
