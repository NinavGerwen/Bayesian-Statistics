model {
## likelihood in a for-loop:
	for (i in 1:length(attitude)) {
		attitude[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau)
		mu[i] <- beta0 + beta1 * extraversion[i] + beta2 * agreeableness[i] + beta3 * (agreeableness[i] - agreeableness.bar) * (extraversion[i] - extraversion.bar)
		## remove past beta2 for no interaction
		## if wanted, you can center x's by doing (x[i] - x.bar) and specifying x.bar

}
agreeableness.bar <- mean(agreeableness)
extraversion.bar <- mean(extraversion)
## Prior distributions:
beta0 ~ dnorm(0.0, 0.00001)
## Variance is in the form of precision (1/variance), so for uninformative, it should be very small (a.k.a. large variance)
beta1 ~ dnorm(0.0, 0.00001)
beta2 ~ dnorm(0.0, 0.00001)
beta3 ~ dnorm(0.0, 0.00001)
## This is so we get standard deviation:
sigma <- 1.0/sqrt(tau)

## Prior for residual variance:
tau ~ dgamma(0.001, 0.001)
}

## Can also do betas in a vector and then do the priors in a for-loop!
